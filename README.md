# Instructions
You will need to run the schema.sql file first in order to create the starting database, then navigate to the repo folder in your terminal and npm install to download the necessary modules. You will then need to create a .env file to set the database environment variables.

Open any of the bamazon.js files, and inquirer will walk you through the steps to operate the program. bamazonCustomer.js will allow you to purchase any of the available items in the products table. bamazonManager.js will allow you to add new items to the database, order more stock for existing items, or view the items that have low inventory. bamazonSupervisor.js will allow you to add new departments, and view the sales by department. You can exit any of the programs by selecting the quit option or pressing ctrl/cmd+c.
